    <p style="float: right ;"> Tokidoki Bosotto Roshia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san (Japanese: 時々ボソッとロシア語でデレる隣のアーリャさん Tokidoki bosotto roshia-go de dereru tonari no A:rya-san, "Sometimes Alya Suddenly Flirts in Russian"[a]), also briefly RoshiDere (Japanese: ロシデレ Rosidere)[3] is a light novel by a Japanese writer under the pseudonym Sansan SUN (Japanese: 燦々SUN), illustrated by Momoko. After noticing the stories on the Shosetsuka ni Naro website, Kadokawa Shoten began publishing a reworked long story, with 10 volumes released as of September 2024. The story was adapted into an anime series by Doga Kobo, which aired from July to September 2024. A second season was announced in September 2024[4], with a planned premiere in 2026.On March 17, 2023, Kadokawa announced an anime adaptation of the light novel and posted two trailers online: "Russian" and "Japanese" (with Japanese subtitles). Sumire Uesaka and Kohei Amasaki will retain their roles as Ali and Masachika, respectively. On September 24, a poster and a video with a new 3D model of Ali were released, and the creators of the anime and new seiyuu were revealed. The series is being directed by Ryota Ito at Doga Kobo, with Yuhei Murota appointed as the character designer. The broadcast was originally scheduled for April 2024, but was later postponed to July of the same year. The anime series aired from July 3 to September 18, 2024 on Tokyo MX, BS NTV, and other TV channels. The opening theme of the anime series is "Ichiban Kagayaku Hoshi" (Japanese: 1番輝く星 Ichiban Kagayaku Hoshi, "Brightest Star"), performed by Sumire Uesaka on behalf of her character; the closing theme songs are Uesaka's covers of various songs (episodes 1-11), as well as an original song (episode 12).
Outside Asia, the anime series is licensed by the streaming service Crunchyroll, in several Asian countries by Ani-One Asia, and in Russia by DEEP, and is broadcast on the Kinopoisk and IVI services.
On September 18, 2024, the day the twelfth episode was shown, a second season was announced. Its director is Hiroshi Haraguchi, the screenwriter is Yuka Yamada, and the character designer is Yuhei Murota again. The premiere is scheduled for 2026.</p>
